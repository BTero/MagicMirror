# MagicMirror
This project was inpsired by Michael Teeuw's [Magic Mirror](http://michaelteeuw.nl/tagged/magicmirror). 

A simple website hosted on an Apache websever running on a Raspberry Pi. The website currently displays the date, time, and weather. </br>
Slight difference from Teeuw version. Doesn't run as a php script. Using a post-receive githook with xdotool to refresh webpage.

### Future Features
* Display motivation quotes that are saved on reddit.
* Post notifications of tv shows that I follow.
* Integrate Trello to display tasks.
